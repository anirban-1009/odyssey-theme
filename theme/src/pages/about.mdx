        <p>
            I am Anirban Sikdar, an undergraduate Computer Science
            Engineering(Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) Student. I have
            a keen interest in Image Processing, Robotics, Deep Space research and
            Astronomy. Building visualisations and interactive systems for the
            concepts been taught and watching them in action is the most fun part of
            building things. I have also gained experience in Raspberry Pi and also
            on various IOT platforms as Thingsboards and Adafruit IO.<br /><br />

            I have a Problem solving instinct where when i face one i don't usually
            tend to back-off easily ðŸ˜‰.
