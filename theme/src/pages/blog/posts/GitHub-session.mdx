## What I think about GitHub?

Today here i am going to take time to convey my Thoughts on what I think about GitHub. So two questions arise now why GitHub? and why now?..So, I am about to talk, write, or convet about it.

### Why GitHub?
So whenever there is an article out there about GitHub they talk about what is github and stuff like that so I am going to consider all the bright minds which stumbled upon this page know about GitHub. But anyway considering the helping nature guy I am, [Here](https://docs.github.com/en) you can go and help yourself ðŸ˜‰.

So as we know GitHub was been aquired by Microsoft but it was open-soucre in the days I came to know about this cool tool, aah good Olden days where propreitory was just a word and capitalism was something I admired. So, in the days when I was into making projects from YouTube following random guys and barely speaking the English and being much of an introvert, it was a awesome thing to get to know about I used it to upload my folders(Project) into the platform.

The idea of remotly pushing just a bunch of folders into the internet and accessing it over the internet which was something of a fantasy in it's way made me and still make's me look into the sky and belive I can also be something which was maybe not in the head of my creator, and it's still something that drives me and to be vague enough.


But ain't no glory day with it's set of mistakes like you need to learn a lot of stuff you ain't stargazing, so my mistake was i was using windows, yeah I am a culprit too but it molded me into the mindset of everything technology must have google, Microsoft, or Facebook attached to, if it's otherwise I don't acknowledge it's existence.

But the thing i wanna communicate to anyone who is reading is that be always the one who doesn't want to fit in but create there own way of doing stuff, never be the one who just does something because other people are doing it, which is something I am trying too. Let's see where it takes me and always get the knowledge from place where the only thing that is costing you is time.

### So why now on 03-Dec-2022?

So on this day "The 03/12/2022" I have just given my session on GitHub for begginers at my Grad school, where I came to know alot about what I am and who are people I am surrounded with and what should I be doing to make things better maybe. But on this day something which is clear to me is that people do want to learn something new not just because they have to but there is an instinct, that's how humans are hot wired ig but that is something which attracts or make me proud about being a human, ofc apart from doing a lot of bad stuff, give or take is been done by a bunch of over-influention bucket headed guys.

But this instinct made us reach places where we aren't supposed to be learn somthing which if given we wouldn't be able to do, but at the same time if we are surrounded by the same people who respect the inginuity you have make you go an extra mile from where you are supposed to end up. And also our generation's Education system is broken too, but sometimes you meet people who don't settle with the answer "You are not supposed to have it or do it" they want all the tools which they can have make stuff better for them and people around them. They are the who should have been leading us from the front not old dudes with ever older ideas of how a community should be and how people are supposed to express themselves.

So about the event the kids were great I could have seen the same passion like the one I have or maybe I used to have that if there is somehting I want to have and learn, It's upto me and I am the only who can push or stop me so gambel everything you have on it and make the best out of the set-backs you have.
