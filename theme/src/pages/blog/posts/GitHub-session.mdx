### Introduction


In this article we'll be learning about Git as a technolgy and why version Control as a practice is emphasied in any project management.

> What is Version Control?

`Version Control is the practice of tracking the changes to a software code.`

### Why we need Version Control and Git?

> What is Version Control as a whole?

A stated above Version control is the practice of tracking the changes made to a software code,
Everyone has a lifeline where the actions of a person is recorded subconciously, like one's first create,
first love, first house, as a milestone these are what shapes an individual and helps them grow,
imagine what if we can go back to a point in life and remake the decisions we already made. This is 
what **Vesion Control** helps us to do in a software code timeline, where we can revert to the changes we made,
track what are the changes being made and also which change contributed to the recent error or any mishap.

> What is Git?

As there is difference between a principle and implementation, there is a need for technology to implement the idea of **Version Control**
this is where git comes into picture, it is a modern version control system, which is mature, activily maintained and is opensource.
It is a technolgy which helped and guided many platforms to come forward in efficiently implement the principle,
moreover those platforms aslo provided the developers with all the functionalities to efficiently work in a team.

Major platforms which provide the version control functionalities are:
    * GitHub
    * GitLab

#### GitHub
It is a Microsoft owned propreitory version control platform, which was previoulsy an completely opensource project famous among a large
group of software developers and beginner engineers as a whole. But after it's acquisition by MicroSoft a range of public favourite functionalities are threatend
and there quality has become quite quesitonable.

#### GitLab
It is an Opensource version control platform which can be redeveloped and redistributed with higher degree of customizable features, and it also an ideal case of DevOps implementation platform,
where it supports CI/CD(Contious Integration and Development), and also a very team friendly and productive features accompany this tool

### Is Verision Control and Git as a technology important to learn?

In my experience before a beginner embarked on the journey of starting learning an technology or a framework,
I would suggest them to learn the basics and functionalities of such a platform because of the arguement that there is practically no credible way
of transferring knowledge to someone about how much a person has worked over a time. But having a continuous presence on platform like this
and being able to showcase the learnings of a person and conributions to other technolgies is really an asset.
Because this is something that is considered in the real worl from where i am standing
and it also does justice to the person showcasing there skills since on platforms like these you cannot 
showcase something you don't have any idea about unlike the ceritficates which many of my peers seek.

I somewhere regret of not being so active on channels like these in my earlier stages which may have lead me to
being a confident and successful contributor which bars me to a certain level, starting at a stage where i am
since it has not being of somehting of a habit, I am not certainly being able to focus on it.
Any platform or technology(i.e: Good one) not just bring a direct functionalty which it aimed to but, it also brings a range of other scope of developments to a person
in this case it brings a sense of scale for anyone of how many things are yet to learn and what the people around are upto,
even though you cannot come to the same calliber now but will certainly reach at that sometime.

It also has a team maintaining functionaly to it where you can assign and manage the issue
within a project which if not drastically but somewhere increases the productivity of a team.
Which is a good tool and way to also track progress of a team in real terms without the scope of 
ambiguity something that counts.

### Conclusion

It cannot be further overstated that at the end of the day the persons own will is the driving facor
 of there learning and progress, but having a good hand on some of platforms like this exposes us to the 
world in real terms, where if it's upto me that's what drives me like this person knows something I don't and 
makes me push further than I am so yeah everyone should be jealous over the fact that this person knows more than what I know
and should drive them to know further more stuff than the person, I see no harm in that.
