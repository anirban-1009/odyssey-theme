## Introduction
So this question arised at the point when I was having metro as a daily way of comute, Is the metro eco-firendly? What is eco-friendly? Just making something electric is eco-friendly?, So there is this vague idea of putting electric into anything makes it carbon neutral and more or less is **GOOD**, but is it? Isn't the current electric revolution, if not less is on the offset of the fact that the current infrastructure is more or less relied on the thermal energy stations. Is that the optimal way of doing things??
