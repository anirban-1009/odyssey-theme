## Introduction
So this question arised at the point when I was having metro as a daily way of comute, Is the metro eco-firendly? What is eco-friendly? Just making something electric is eco-friendly?, So there is this vague idea of putting electric into anything makes it carbon neutral and more or less is **GOOD**, but is it? Isn't the current electric revolution, if not less is on the offset of the fact that the current infrastructure is more or less relied on the thermal energy stations. Is that the optimal way of doing things??

## Describe the Problem!
So the issue the one we are facing, atleast I am is that the question what is **Eco-friendly**? Because let's face it we are mostly on thermal as India. So i did the most simplest thing I could have done just a web search so here what returned...

So if you see there are some points stated here the details are very vague in nature they try to give you the mental perception of it being a very nature positive way of travel but it dosen't give you any positive or conclusive data. The terms used are very uncertain at a glance.

* 10,000 tons of CO2 removal if taken as mode of public transport by the commutors.

* 200 tons of volatile organic compounds, and 12 tons of particulate matter to be reduced.

* 5,000 CO2 will be removed from the surrounding because of the [Rolling Stock](https://www.ltmetro.in/hyderabad-metro-rail/project-highlights/rolling-stock/).

* Saving $5,000,000 environmental damage cost which would have cost due to the harmful gases.

Those are some bold statements and makes you feel all good about it, but a thing pops into my mind is it really a good deal. But is it? or a too good to be true deal?

Among all other questions in my mind like

- How are they removing the carbon from the space?

- How much are they rellying on the existing grid, which is on thermal source to be true?

- And how did they cover the carbon they emmited during the construction?

#### For the purpose of this article lets just look at how eco-friendly is Hyderabad Metro Network and How much is indian power network is dependent on fossil fuel?

Let's have a look at what I found and my views on them.

## Causes & Effects

- #### How much was the carbon footprint of construction of Hyderbad Metro Network?

    * Construction of the Hyderabad Metro Rail is estimated to be around 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)

    * The construction of the Hyderabad Metro Rail also generated around 100,000 tonnes of construction waste. This waste was mostly disposed of in landfills, which released methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

- #### How much of the metro's power supply requirements rely on renewable source of energy?
    * HMRP has a continuous cooperations with **Amp Energy India** which has installed and commitioned solar panel on the rooftop of the stations, the following article states it has been in operation from 26th December 2022 which will supply the **15% of the power requirements**. I just wonder where the rest of the power comes from i.e:**85%**.

    * ***Let's have a glance at the Indian power demographics which has been used by this network the rest of the nation.***

        ![Energy Split](../../../assets/images/green-metro/3.png)
    The above is the split of Energy infrastructure in India as of 2023.

    - If the metro and all the other infrastructures which clam to be a **Green future** if not rely on this existing infrastructure we should realy find the real meaning of sustainable or re-define it to our convinence, Otherwise it would a be a dillusion upon which we are going to be a carbon neutral nation. If we do what ever we are planing to then we need to transition far from the non-renewable to something which is renewable.
    <br />

- #### How much carbon does HMRP removes from the environment?
    - The Hyderabad Metro is estimated to remove about **1.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the environment each year**. This is equivalent to taking about 240,000 cars off the road.

    - In 2020, these modes of transportation were responsible for an estimated **12 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions** in the city. This is equivalent to the emissions of over 2.5 million cars.

    - The main reason for this high level of emissions is the use of fossil fuels to power these vehicles. Cars and buses typically run on gasoline or diesel, while two-wheelers often use petrol.

    - But to the contrary to the conventional modes of transport the metro network is not directly dependent on fossil fuel, instead is dependent on electricity which can be generated by other methods.

## Possible Solution

- #### How much time would it take for HMRP to remove the carbon it created and is continuing to emit?

    - Hyderbad Metro Project removes approximately **1,000 tones of CO2 per day** from the environment by giving alternative to the existing conventional transport methods.

    - As the things are going it would take **1,200 days** of operations to remove the standing pollution of the use of concrete alone, As of today, May 15, 2023, there have been **1182 working days and total no.of days standing at  1,995 days** since November 28, 2017,the day of inception of the metro adding to that the CVC footprint of the air-conditioning used, and it's power consumption on the conventional method of power which is **85%**.

    - Adding to the picture that the operations are expanding and there is contiuous construction going on.

- #### Does having public transport infrastructure really help?
    - **Yeah, it does** the inception of the metro projects, has removed alot of public transport from the street, on a usual basis. And has make them to use a relatively a greener transport method.

    - I really think that the key to solving the problem of is the upgration of the of current public transport infrastructure, since the more people use the public transport the less they'll rely on there private mode of transport which is as of now *for the year 2023 is contributing around **4463 Gg (Giga-gram) of CO2 per year** towards our pollution basket.

    - If we can upgrade the existing public transport infrastructure in a sustainable manner, which is the only way to curb the carbon footprint of the indian urban landscape. Then only we can effectlively transisiton to a greener and healthy future.

- #### How does are the other alternative and projects working?
    - In general, public transport is more efficient than private cars in terms of fuel consumption and emissions. For example, a study by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay found that a metro train can carry the same number of passengers as 4,000 cars, but it produces only 10% of the emissions.

    - As a result, upgrading public transport can lead to significant reductions in carbon emissions. For example, a study by the World Bank found that upgrading public transport in Delhi could reduce carbon emissions by up to 20%.

    - The Delhi Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **1.5 million tonnes per year**.
    
    - The Mumbai Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **1 million tonnes per year**.
    
    - The Bangalore Metro has reduced carbon emissions by an estimated **0.5 million tonnes per year**.

    - Chennai Monorail is estimated to reduce carbon emissions by **100,000 tonnes per year**.


## Conclusion

- There is minimal accountability over the fictional use of **being eco-friendly** term now-a-days, which should be made accountable for.

- General public should have the sound knowledge of how being just Electric changes something, but not to the degree upto which we are crediting it with. Having a dillusion of making something electric makes it eco-firendly will leave a long lasting effect on our efforts in moving towards a green future.

- But at the same time I also came to know that the approach to direct solution for the emissions caused by private transport and methods likewise, will be solved by upgrading the public transit infrastructure. But when the construction space in our nation and state, the need of having a sustainable method of doing operations, more projects like these can do more harm than being helpful.

- Making sustainable construction is a long path to go being acknowledged and I know that it can happen, since we have seen the development in the space of solar energy which once was not the most efficient, and feasible way of obtain electricity has now become of the most efficient and cheap thing to do.

- India has been transitioning from conventional to the renewable energy source over the time which has been great but the pace if being more aggresive can help a lot than what it is now.

![India renewable](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/India_renewable_electricity_production.svg/1024px-India_renewable_electricity_production.svg.png)

- We as a community should vouch for more upgrades in public transport system than, raising requests for upgrades to the transit upgrades for the private vehicles to run on like fly-overs less aggresively. We should also di-stigmatize travelling in public transits, at the sametime being responsible and sound about how much is being invested and what to expect, rather than just blaming the establishment.
