			<h1>Greating Humans!!</h1>
			<p>
				I am Anirban Sikdar, an undergraduate Computer Science Engineering(Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) Student.
        I have a keen interest in Image Processing, Robotics, Deep Space research and Astronomy.
        Building visualisations and interactive systems for the concepts been taught and watching them in action is the most fun part of building things. I have also gained experience in Raspberry Pi and also on various IOT platforms as Thingsboards and Adafruit IO.<br /><br />

        I have a Problem solving instinct where when i face one i don't usually tend to back-off easily ðŸ˜‰.
